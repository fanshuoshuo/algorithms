<P>Businesses like to have memorable telephone numbers. One way to make =
a=20
telephone number memorable is to have it spell a memorable word or =
phrase. For=20
example, you can call the University of Waterloo by dialing the =
memorable=20
TUT-GLOP. Sometimes only part of the number is used to spell a word. =
When you=20
get back to your hotel tonight you can order a pizza from Gino's by =
dialing=20
310-GINO. Another way to make a telephone number memorable is to group =
the=20
digits in a memorable way. You could order your pizza from Pizza Hut by =
calling=20
their ``three tens'' number 3-10-10-10.=20
<P>
<P><BR>The standard form of a telephone number is seven decimal digits =
with a=20
hyphen between the third and fourth digits (e.g. 888-1200). The keypad =
of a=20
phone supplies the mapping of letters to numbers, as follows:=20
<P>
<P><BR>A, B, and C map to 2=20
<P>D, E, and F map to 3=20
<P>G, H, and I map to 4=20
<P>J, K, and L map to 5=20
<P>M, N, and O map to 6=20
<P>P, R, and S map to 7=20
<P>T, U, and V map to 8=20
<P>W, X, and Y map to 9=20
<P>
<P><BR>There is no mapping for Q or Z. Hyphens are not dialed, and can =
be added=20
and removed as necessary. The standard form of TUT-GLOP is 888-4567, the =

standard form of 310-GINO is 310-4466, and the standard form of =
3-10-10-10 is=20
310-1010.=20
<P>
<P><BR>Two telephone numbers are equivalent if they have the same =
standard form.=20
(They dial the same number.)=20
<P>
<P><BR>Your company is compiling a directory of telephone numbers from =
local=20
businesses. As part of the quality control process you want to check =
that no two=20
(or more) businesses in the directory have the same telephone number.=20

consist of one case. The first line of the input specifies the number of =

telephone numbers in the directory (up to 100,000) as a positive integer =

on the line. The remaining lines list the telephone numbers in the =
directory,=20
with each number alone on a line. Each telephone number consists of a =

composed of decimal digits, uppercase letters (excluding Q and Z) and =
hyphens.=20
Exactly seven of the characters in the string will be digits or letters. =
