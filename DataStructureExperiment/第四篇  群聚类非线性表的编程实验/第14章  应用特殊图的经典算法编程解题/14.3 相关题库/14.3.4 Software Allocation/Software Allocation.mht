<P>A computing center has ten different computers (numbered 0 to 9) on =
which=20
applications can run. The computers are not multi-tasking, so each =
machine can=20
run only one application at any time. There are 26 applications, named A =

Whether an application can run on a particular computer can be found in =
a job=20
description (see below).=20
<P>
<P>Every morning, the users bring in their applications for that day. It =
is=20
possible that two users bring in the same application; in that case two=20
different, independent computers will be allocated for that application. =

<P>
<P>A clerk collects the applications, and for each different application =
he=20
makes a list of computers on which the application could run. Then, he =
assigns=20
each application to a computer. Remember: the computers are <I>not</I>=20
multi-tasking, so each computer must handle at most one application in =
total.=20
(An application takes a day to complete, so that sequencing i.e. one =
application=20
after another on the same machine is not possible.)=20
<P>A job description consists of=20
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>one upper case letter <TT>A...Z</TT>, indicating the application.
  <LI>one digit <TT>1...9</TT>, indicating the number of users who =
brought in=20
  the application.
  <LI>a blank (space character.)
  <LI>one or more different digits <TT>0...9</TT>, indicating the =
computers on=20
  which the application can run.
  <LI>a terminating semicolon `<TT>;</TT>'.
  <LI>an end-of-line. </LI></OL>

<P>The input for your program is a textfile. For each day it contains =
one or=20
more job descriptions, separated by a line containing only the =
end-of-line=20

your program determines whether an allocation of applications to =
computers can=20
be done, and if so, generates a possible allocation.=20
