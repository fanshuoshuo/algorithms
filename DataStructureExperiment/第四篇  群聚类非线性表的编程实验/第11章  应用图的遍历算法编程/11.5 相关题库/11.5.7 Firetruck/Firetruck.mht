<P>The Center City fire department collaborates with the transportation=20
department to maintain maps of the city which reflects the current =
status of the=20
city streets. On any given day, several streets are closed for repairs =
or=20
construction. Firefighters need to be able to select routes from the=20
firestations to fires that do not use closed streets.=20
<P>
<P>Central City is divided into non-overlapping fire districts, each =
containing=20
a single firestation. When a fire is reported, a central dispatcher =
alerts the=20
firestation of the district where the fire is located and gives a list =
of=20
possible routes from the firestation to the fire. You must write a =
program that=20
the central dispatcher can use to generate routes from the district =
firestations=20
to the fires.=20

<P>The city has a separate map for each fire district. Streetcorners of =
each map=20
are identified by positive integers less than 21, with the firestation =
always on=20
corner #1. The input file contains several test cases representing =
different=20
fires in different districts.=20
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>The first line of a test case consists of a single integer which =
is the=20
  number of the streetcorner closest to the fire.
  <LI>The next several lines consist of pairs of positive integers =
separated by=20
  blanks which are the adjacent streetcorners of open streets. (For =
example, if=20
  the pair 4 7 is on a line in the file, then the street between =
streetcorners 4=20
  and 7 is open. There are no other streetcorners between 4 and 7 on =
that=20
  section of the street.)
  <LI>The final line of each test case consists of a pair of 0's. =

<P>For each test case, your output must identify the case by number =
(<TT>CASE=20
#1</TT>, <TT>CASE #2</TT>, etc). It must list each route on a separate =
line,=20
with the streetcorners written in the order in which they appear on the =
route.=20
And it must give the total number routes from firestation to the fire. =
Include=20
only routes which do not pass through any streetcorner more than once. =
(For=20
obvious reasons, the fire department doesn't want its trucks driving =
around in=20
circles.)=20
