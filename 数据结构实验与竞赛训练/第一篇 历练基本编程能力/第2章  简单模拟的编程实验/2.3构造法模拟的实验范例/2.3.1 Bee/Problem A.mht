<P>In Africa there is a very special species of bee. Every year, the =
female bees=20
of such species give birth to one male bee, while the male bees give =
birth to=20
one male bee and one female bee, and then they die!=20
<P>Now scientists have accidentally found one "magical female bee" of =
such=20
special species to the effect that she is immortal, but still able to =
give birth=20
once a year as all the other female bees. The scientists would like to =
know how=20
many bees there will be after N years. Please write a program that helps =
them=20
find the number of male bees and the total number of all bees after N =
years.=20

<P>Each line of output should have two numbers, the first one being the =

after N years. (The two numbers will not exceed 2<SUP>32</SUP>.)=20
