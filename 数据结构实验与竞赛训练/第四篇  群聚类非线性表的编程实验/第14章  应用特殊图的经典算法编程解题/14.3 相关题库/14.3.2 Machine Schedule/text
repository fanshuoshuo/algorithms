<p>As we all know, machine scheduling is a very classical problem in computer 
  science and has been studied for a very long history. Scheduling problems differ 
  widely in the nature of the constraints that must be satisfied and the type 
  of schedule desired. Here we consider a 2-machine scheduling problem.<br>
  <br>
  There are two machines A and B. Machine A has n kinds of working modes, which 
  is called mode_0, mode_1, бн, mode_n-1, likewise machine B has m kinds of working 
  modes, mode_0, mode_1, бн , mode_m-1. At the beginning they are both work at 
  mode_0.<br>
  <br>
  For k jobs given, each of them can be processed in either one of the two machines 
  in particular mode. For example, job 0 can either be processed in machine A 
  at mode_3 or in machine B at mode_4, job 1 can either be processed in machine 
  A at mode_2 or in machine B at mode_4, and so on. Thus, for job i, the constraint 
  can be represent as a triple (i, x, y), which means it can be processed either 
  in machine A at mode_x, or in machine B at mode_y.<br>
  <br>
  Obviously, to accomplish all the jobs, we need to change the machine's working 
  mode from time to time, but unfortunately, the machine's working mode can only 
  be changed by restarting it manually. By changing the sequence of the jobs and 
  assigning each job to a suitable machine, please write a program to minimize 
  the times of restarting machines. </p>

  <b>Input</b><br>
  <br>
  The input file for this program consists of several configurations. The first 
  line of one configuration contains three positive integers: n, m (n, m &lt; 
  100) and k (k &lt; 1000). The following k lines give the constrains of the k 
  jobs, each line is a triple: i, x, y.<br>
  <br>
  The input will be terminated by a line containing a single zero.</p>
<p><br>
  <b>Output</b><br>
  <br>
  The output should be one integer per line, which means the minimal times of 
  restarting machine.</p>
