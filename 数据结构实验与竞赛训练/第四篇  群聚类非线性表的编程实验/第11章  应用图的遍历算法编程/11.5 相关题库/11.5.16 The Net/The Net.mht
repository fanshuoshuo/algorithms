<P>Taking into account the present interest in the Internet, a smart =
information=20
routing becomes a must. This job is done by routers situated in the =
nodes of the=20
network. Each router has its own list of routers which are visible for =
him (so=20
called ``routing table"). It is obvious that the information should be =
directed=20
in the way which minimizes number of routers it has to pass (so called =
``hop=20
count").=20
<P>
<P><BR>Your task is to find an optimal route (minimal hop count) for the =
given=20
network form the source of the information to its destination.=20
