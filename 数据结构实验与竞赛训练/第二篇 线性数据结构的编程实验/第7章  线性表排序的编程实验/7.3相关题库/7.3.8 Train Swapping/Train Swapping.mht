<P>At an old railway station, you may still encounter one of the last =
remaining=20
``train swappers''. A train swapper is an employee of the railroad, =
whose sole=20
job it is to rearrange the carriages of trains.=20
<P>Once the carriages are arranged in the optimal order, all the train =
driver=20
has to do, is drop the carriages off, one by one, at the stations for =
which the=20
load is meant.=20
<P>
<P>The title ``train swapper'' stems from the first person who performed =
this=20
task, at a station close to a railway bridge. Instead of opening up =
vertically,=20
the bridge rotated around a pillar in the center of the river. After =
rotating=20
the bridge 90 degrees, boats could pass left or right.=20
<P>The first train swapper had discovered that the bridge could be =
operated with=20
at most two carriages on it. By rotating the bridge 180 degrees, the =
carriages=20
switched place, allowing him to rearrange the carriages (as a side =
effect, the=20
carriages then faced the opposite direction, but train carriages can =
move either=20
way, so who cares).=20
<P>Now that almost all train swappers have died out, the railway company =
would=20
like to automate their operation. Part of the program to be developed, =
is a=20
routine which decides for a given train the least number of swaps of two =

adjacent carriages necessary to order the train. Your assignment is to =
create=20
that routine.=20

Each test case consists of two input lines. The first line of a test =
