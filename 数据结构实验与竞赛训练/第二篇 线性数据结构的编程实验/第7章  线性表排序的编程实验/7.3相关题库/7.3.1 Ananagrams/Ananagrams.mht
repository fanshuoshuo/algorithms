<P>Most crossword puzzle fans are used to <EM>anagrams</EM>--groups of =
words=20
with the same letters in different orders--for example OPTS, SPOT, STOP, =
POTS=20
and POST. Some words however do not have this attribute, no matter how =
you=20
rearrange their letters, you cannot form another word. Such words are =
called=20
<EM>ananagrams</EM>, an example is QUIZ.=20
<P>
<P>Obviously such definitions depend on the domain within which we are =
working;=20
you might think that ATHENE is an ananagram, whereas any chemist would =
quickly=20
produce ETHANE. One possible domain would be the entire English =
language, but=20
this could lead to some problems. One could restrict the domain to, say, =
Music,=20
in which case SCALE becomes a <EM>relative ananagram</EM> (LACES is not =
in the=20
same domain) but NOTE is not since it can produce TONE.=20
<P>
<P>Write a program that will read in the dictionary of a restricted =
domain and=20
determine the relative ananagrams. Note that single letter words are, =
ipso=20
facto, relative ananagrams since they cannot be ``rearranged'' at all. =
The=20
dictionary will contain no more than 1000 words.=20

name=3DSECTION0001001000000000000000>Input</A></FONT></H2>
<P>Input will consist of a series of lines. No line will be more than 80 =

characters long, but may contain any number of words. Words consist of =
up to 20=20
upper and/or lower case letters, and will not be broken across lines. =
Spaces may=20
appear freely around words, and at least one space separates multiple =
words on=20
the same line. Note that words that contain the same letters but of =
differing=20
case are considered to be anagrams of each other, thus tIeD and EdiT are =

anagrams. The file will be terminated by a line consisting of a single=20
<TT>#</TT>.=20

<P>Output will consist of a series of lines. Each line will consist of a =
single=20
word that is a relative ananagram in the input dictionary. Words must be =
output=20
in lexicographic (case-sensitive) order. There will always be at least =
one=20
relative ananagram.=20
